        <h4 id="sec1.1">1.1 Purpose</h4>
        <p>Purpose of Software Requirements Specification (SRS) is to describe the specific descriptions of our project ''Fitness365''. This Software Requirements Specification illustrates in clear terms of system's primary uses and required functionality so that the next developers can easily understand what we did and how to change anything if it is required.

            <h4 id="sec2.1">2.1 Product Perspective</h4>
            <p> This product is not a follow-on member of any product family but a replacement of the existing gym and fitness management system.
    Fitness365 will digitalize all the processes that occur between a gym-owner (admin) and its members (user) in a very personalized manner. The admin will be able to send the users customized diet-chart, workout plan, track their payment and attendance pattern. The users will be able to pay their gym membership fee, view the diet/workout plan assigned to them

            <h4 id="sec2.2">2.2 Product Functions</h4>
            <p> The product functions are given below:
      <ul>
        <li>Gym manager can assign customized diet chart and workout routine to clients.</li>
          <li>Clients will be reminded of their diet chart in the designated time of the day via push notifications</li>
            <li>Clients will be able to view their workout routine, pay membership fee, submit attendance.</li>
              <li>Gym manager can track their payment records and attendance.</li>
                <li>The system will generate an automated report based on the change in pattern of user attendance.</li>
      </ul>

            </p>
            <h4 id="sec2.3">2.3 User Classes and Characteristics</h4>
            <p> There will be three types of user classes: Admin, User and System.<br/>

              <ul>
    <li>Login/Logout</li>
    <li>Register/Delete User</li>
    <li>Send customized diet chart and workout routine to users.  </li>
    <li>Track payment status and attendance  </li>
                </ul>
                User will:
                <ul>
      <li>Login/Logout </li>
      <li>View their workout routine and diet chart </li>
      <li>Pay membership fee</li>

    </ul>
    <h4 id="sec2.30">2.4 Use Case Diagram </h4>

      <p class="UI"><img class="editme" src="img/uc.png"></p>





            <h4 id="sec2.4">2.5 Operating Environments</h4>
            <p> The operating environment is given below:
            <!-- For listing the attributes -->
            <ul> <li>Platform: Web and android</li>
                 <li>Operating System: Any which supports modern browsers i.e Chrome, Firefox, etc.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4 id="sec2.5">2.6 Design and Implementation Constraints</h4>
            <p> <ul>
              <li>Efficiently tracking the user attendance pattern will be a design constraint. </li>
              <li>Users must have stable internet connection otherwise data transfer will not occur. </li>
              </ul>
            <h4 id="sec2.6">2.7 User Documentation</h4>
            <p> There will be two separate user manuals, one for the admin and the other for the clients which will state all the functionalities of their respective user modes.
            <h4 id="sec2.7">2.8 Assumptions and Dependencies</h4>
            <p>The payment feature is dependent on Bkash API as of now. Any changes made to that by Bkash themselves will affect it. Users must have stable internet connection to receive notifications regarding their diet and workout plan.</p>

     <h2 style="color:#1B4F72 ;">3. External Interface</h2>
            <h4 id="sec3.1">3.1 User Interface (Admin)</h4> <br/>
            <p class="UI"><img class="editme" src="img/ui.png"></p>

            <h4 id="sec3.2">3.2 Hardware Interfaces</h4>
            <p>There are no exclusive hardware requirements. The product will be supported by all kinds of smartphones.

            <h4 id="sec3.3">3.3 Software Interfaces</h4>
            <p>Browsers that support HTML5,CSS3 and JavaScript will ensure the optimal interaction and responsiveness of the website.

            <h4 id="sec3.4">Communications Interfaces</h4>
            <p>The browser and the operating system will handle the communication between different parts of the software.
